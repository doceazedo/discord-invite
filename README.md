## Usage ðŸ”—

Embed this image URL anywhere you want:

```
https://discord-invite.doceazedo.com/[INVITE].png
```

You will probably also want to wrap the image with your invite link. You can do this using HTML like so:

```html
<a href="https://discord.gg/XXXXXXXXXX">
	<img src="https://discord-invite.doceazedo.com/XXXXXXXXXX.png" />
</a>
```

If you prefer Markdown, it will depend a bit on the flavor used by each platform. In general, you can do something link this:

```md
[![](https://discord-invite.doceazedo.com/XXXXXXXXXX.png)](https://discord.gg/XXXXXXXXXX)
```

Or even BBCode:

```
[url=https://discord.gg/XXXXXXXXXX][img]https://discord-invite.doceazedo.com/XXXXXXXXXX.png[/img][/url]
```

## TO-DO ðŸ”®

You can see the TO-DO list for this project [here](https://todo.doceazedo.com/discord-invite).

## Why and how? ðŸ¤”

Discord does not offer an official invite widget, but only a guild iframe showing a list of online members and channels.

This app allows anyone to add guild invites anywhere outside of Discord by using just an image that resembles the official in-app invite.

This is possible by using the Discord API to fetch the invite link data and generate the image on the fly using [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori).

## Development ðŸ§°

This is a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) app, so everything should work just like any other SvelteKit project.

You can run the development server with:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the image generator by modifying [`src/routes/[invite].svg/+server.ts`](/src/routes/[invite].svg/+server.ts).
